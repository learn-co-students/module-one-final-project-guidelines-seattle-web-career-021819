# Boozy
## By Reid Boudreau and Kim Heidorn

### How do I play?
Below is a short clip of the game.
BUT in case you love reading, *Boozy* is a simple cocktail guessing game.
The user logs in and is presented with either ingredients and a recipe (easy mode)
or ingredients only (hard mode). With the given information, the user must guess 
the name of the cocktail. Users aren't expected to know all 500+ drink names, so to help the 
user guess we provide 4 potential answers. The one caveat, SPELLING MATTERS.
The user plays a total of 5 rounds and will then be award 10 points for each correct answer.
The user's points are tracked over each new game, and the user accumulates a "total points" value across all games.
