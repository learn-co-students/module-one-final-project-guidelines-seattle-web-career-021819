##Welcome

For our final project we have built a database sourced from the Game of Thrones "Ice and Fire" API. We have provided instructions below for you to run the application on your local computer.


##Details
We have built a Game of Thrones themed searching database using An API Of Ice And Fire. This public database is hosted at https://anapioficeandfire.com/ and requires no authorization to use. Using our CLI, a user will be able to:

1.  Choose from a list of Characters, Books or Houses. This will direct the user to a new list of options relating the topic chosen.

2. From here, the user will be able to dive one step deeper into the facts.


##Install Instructions
1. Clone the repository using your favorite clone method, or typing "git clone git@github.com:WTFCodingPotato/module-one-final-project-guidelines-seattle-web-career-021819.git" into your terminal
2. Still in terminal type, "cd module-one-final-project-guidelines-seattle-web-career-021819"
3. Type "bundle install"
4. Type "rake db:migrate"
5. Type "rake seed"
6. Type "rake run" to start the program

###Recognitions

This API uses several frameworks and libraries, with the most important ones being listed below:

ASP.NET Core - The API is built on top of this awesome framework by Microsoft.
Azure - The API has been hosted on Azure from the very first day and it's been a smooth ride ever since.
Dapper - This micro ORM has been invaluable since we switched from Entity Framework. (Information sourced from API website)
